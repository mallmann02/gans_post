# GAN'S

Before the problems, let's first introduce what are our study object this time. So, GAN's are an acronym for Generative Adversarial Networks, let's find out what each of these words mean:

GAN's are a class of `G`enerative models that are trained through an `A`dversarial min-max game between two neural `N`etworks, the generator and the discriminator. We'll talk about the generator and the discriminator in a few moments.

### Looking at the big picture, what are generative models? And how are they different from our old friend class of dicriminative models?

In a intuitive (super) high-level, generative models are a class of models that are used to `generate` new data samples from a given distribution. In the other hand, discriminative models are used to `discriminate` between different kinds of data samples. Enough of the words playing, let's talk under a statistical perspective.

The generative models are used to model the joint distribution of the input data and the labels, $P(X, Y)$ while the discriminative models are used to model the conditional distribution of the labels given the input data, $P(Y|X)$.

Ok, but let's have more intuition about it. For this let's review the concept of <u>conditional probability</u> and <u>joint probability</u>. The joint probability is the probability of two events happening at the same time, while the conditional probability is the probability of one event happening given that another event has already happened.

Looking at both formulas, interstingly, we have some kind of relationship between them (whispers: the Bayes' Theorem):

$$ P(X, Y) = P(X) \cdot P(Y|X) $$

$$ P(Y|X) = \frac{P(X, Y)}{P(X)} $$

Bringing to the example of digits recognition, the discriminative model, in the training step, has access to the input data $X$ that are the pixels $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ of the image and the labels $Y$ that are the digits $0, 1, ..., 9$. So, thinking in a simple classification network, it works by <u>maximizing the likelihood</u> of the labels given the input data, $P(Y|X)$, and it does this by receiving a feedback in the form of "it's right" or "it's wrong" and adjusting the weights in favor of maximizing the likelihood for the specific class $Y$.

In the other hand, the generative model, is all blindfolded and has no idea of the labels nor the input data. Instead, it receives a random input data in the form of a noise vector $z$ and gradually learns to transform it in the "real" input data distribution by maximizing the joint probability: $P(x_1), P(x_2), ..., P(x_n)$, that is, the probability of the pixels of the image occuring together in a certain way. And it does this by receiving a feedback that is the <u>distance</u> of its "transformation" of the data from a real data sample.

### What about the adversarial part of these models?

Now that we have brief over the generative and discriminative models, let's talk about the interaction between them and how we take advantage of this to "generate" new things.

So the adversial part of the GAN's comes from the fact that, although we have two separate neural networks, the optimization process for both are entangled. The advantage of this process establishes as the competition between them leads to an equilibrium of the generator as it, during the training, is using the feedback from the discriminator to drive the approximattion of the sample generation towards the real data distribution.

So, let's get a intuition on this parting from a kind example. Imagine that are sampling random numbers from a certain distribution, let's say for example a Normal Distribution, so we take about 100 samples and plot them in a histogram. This will be our real data distribution. We want to figure out which distribution is this and we will use a feedback loop for this, pretty much like a game of Marco Polo. Let's see the steps:

1. We don't have idea of the distribution, so we start, like in Marco Polo, by saying "Marco": sampling random numbers.
2. The other player will gives us a feedback, saying "Polo", so we know how far we are from our objective.
3. Back in our turn, we take a step in the direction of the feedback and keep repeating the process until we get near the other player.

To visualize it in the example of the distribution, take a look at the GIF below:

In the GIF above, we have a simple example of two Normal Distributions. The blue one is our generated distribution that gradually converges to the real data distribution as it changes it's parameters of mean and variance.

## Architecture visualization and the training process

Is the image above we can see the <u>main components</u> for the GAN architecture.

### Generator

Following our image above, we have our Generator being the yellow box. By it's side, we have little purple triangle that is inputing something in our box, and this the "random noise" - or more simply random numbers following a certain distribution - that we talked about in the beginning. Inside the box, we are doing a transformation of this random noise in a certain form to get a more positive feedback from the discriminator.

Just to not turn our yellow box into a black box, let's talk about the transformation that we are doing. Do you remember when we talked about the generative model and the joint probability? So, the generator is trying to learn the joint probability of the input data $P(X)$, and this learning process is done by a neural network that is trained through the feedback of the discriminator about how distant the generated data is from the real data distribution.

### Discriminator

Also following our image above, we have our Discriminator being the blue box that is receiving two inputs, the "Real Sample" and the "Fake Sample". Inside the box, you can think what's happening as a simple classification process, where a neural network outputs how likely the "Fake Sample" was sampled from the real data distribution. As we'll see, this likelihood is defined by a distance measure that can come is different flavors.

## Loss Functions

### Discriminator Loss

The discriminator loss is a measure of how well the discriminator is able to distinguish between real and fake samples. The discriminator loss is calculated by taking the difference between the output of the discriminator for the real and fake samples. In the original GAN paper, the discriminator loss is defined as the cross-entropy loss between the real and fake samples.

The loss is defined in the following formula:

$$ L_D = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(x)}[\log D(x)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] $$

Where:
- $L_D$ is the discriminator loss
- $x$ is a real sample from the dataset
- $p_{data}(x)$ is the distribution of the real samples
- $D(x)$ is the output of the discriminator for the real sample $x$
- $z$ is a random noise vector
- $G(z)$ is the output of the generator for the random noise vector $z$
- $p_{z}(z)$ is the distribution of the random noise vectors

### Generator Loss

The generator loss is a measure of how well the generator is able to generate samples that fool the discriminator. The generator loss is calculated by taking the negative of the output of the discriminator for the fake samples.

The generator loss is calculated using the following formula:

$$ L_G = -\mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_{z}(z)}[\log D(G(z))] $$

Where:
- $L_G$ is the generator loss
- $z$ is a random noise vector
- $G(z)$ is the output of the generator for the random noise vector $z$
- $D(G(z))$ is the output of the discriminator for the fake sample $G(z)$
- $p_{z}(z)$ is the distribution of the random noise vectors

## Training Process

The training process of a GAN involves training the generator and the discriminator in an alternating fashion. The training process is divided into two main steps: the discriminator step and the generator step.

### Discriminator Step

In the discriminator step, the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and fake samples. The discriminator is trained using the real samples from the dataset and the fake samples generated by the generator. The discriminator is trained to maximize the discriminator loss.

### Generator Step

In the generator step, the generator is trained to generate samples that fool the discriminator. The generator is trained using the random noise vectors as input and the output of the generator as the fake samples. The generator is trained to minimize the generator loss.

The training process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations or until the generator and the discriminator reach a stable equilibrium.

## Training problems

### Mode Collapse

Mode collapse is a common problem in GAN's training process. It occurs when the generator collapses to a single output, generating the same output for all the input noise. This problem is caused by the generator finding a way to fool the discriminator by generating a single output that is able to fool the discriminator.

### Vanishing Gradients

Vanishing gradients is a common problem in GAN's training process. It occurs when the gradients of the generator or the discriminator vanish during the training process. This problem is caused by the generator or the discriminator being unable to learn the distribution of the data.

### Oscillations

Oscillations is a common problem in GAN's training process. It occurs when the generator or the discriminator oscillate between different outputs during the training process. This problem is caused by the generator or the discriminator being unable to find a stable output.

### Unstable Training

Unstable training is a common problem in GAN's training process. It occurs when the generator or the discriminator are unable to find a stable output during the training process. This problem is caused by the generator or the discriminator being unable to learn the distribution of the data.
